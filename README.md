# Meditation_App
Meditation App with relaxing audio instructions from beginning to end.

This particular project is very important and close to me, as I have once decided to build my own calm, headspace sort-of popular meditation app for myself. Now I will be doing daily meditation from this app.
Important learning form this project 
  How to change icon and background image of the app.
  How to work with Seekbar
  Text font, styling of overall app.
  Added daily reminder notification using firebase cloud messaging(FCM)  
<!-- need to commit changes done in android studio new features add -->
and can use alarm manager to select time and days of reminder specific to user itself by following this:-
